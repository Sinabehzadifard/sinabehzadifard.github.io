##### Abstract

This paper aims to provide a step-by-step guide for learning Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) in R software. We start with a brief introduction to the dataset that we will use to analyze. Then, we will walk through a step-by-step process to test the necessary condition hypotheses we proposed in the student guide and interpret the results.
